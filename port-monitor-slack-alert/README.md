A Python tool that monitors the availability of specific TCP ports and sends alerts to a Slack channel if a port goes down. It also logs all events with timestamps for auditing or monitoring purposes.

---

## Features

- Scans specific TCP ports on domains/IPs
- Sends Slack alerts when a port is unreachable
- Logs port status to a local file (`monitor_log.txt`)
- Uses `.env` file for safe config management
- Easy to run with or without virtual environment

---

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Without Virtual Environment (Quick Run)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python monitor.py
```

### Option 2: Recommended (With Virtual Environment)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate     # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the monitor
python monitor.py
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the same directory with this content:

```env
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url
```
